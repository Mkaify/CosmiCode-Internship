# Week 1: Introduction to Deep Learning

## Overview
This week covers the fundamentals of deep learning including:
- Environment setup
- Neural networks from scratch using NumPy
- Data handling with TensorFlow/Keras
- Building and training feedforward neural networks
- Model evaluation and visualization

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Verify installation:
```bash
python setup_verification.py
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
