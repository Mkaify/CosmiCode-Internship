# What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

## Definition of AI
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and problem-solve like humans. AI systems can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

## Types of AI

### 1. Based on Capabilities
- **Narrow AI (Weak AI)**: Designed for specific tasks (e.g., virtual assistants, recommendation systems)
- **General AI (Strong AI)**: Hypothetical AI that matches human cognitive abilities across all domains
- **Super AI**: AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects (theoretical)

### 2. Based on Functionality
- **Reactive Machines**: Respond to specific inputs without memory (e.g., chess-playing computers)
- **Limited Memory**: Learn from historical data to make decisions (e.g., self-driving cars)
- **Theory of Mind**: Understand emotions and beliefs (under development)
- **Self-Aware**: Possess consciousness and self-awareness (hypothetical)
